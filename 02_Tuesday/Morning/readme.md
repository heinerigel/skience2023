The notebooks provided for this morning's class are a continuation of Monday afternoon's introduction to MSNoise. Here we also have a illustration of ways to hack MSNoise to leverage its benefits while still using your own codes. 
Following Shujuan Mao's theoretical introduction, we use the wavelet method on pre-computed cross-correlations of the station CI.LJR in California and compare the results to those in the literature.
1. How to hack msnoise to implement your own dv/v measurement method.
2. How to use the wavelet method to efficiently measure dv/v over a broad frequency range and with high spectral resolution
3. how to assess the depth of the measured changes using surface waves sensitivity kernels

## Requirements
All the CCF files must be copied in the "STACK" folder.

These Python 3  codes rely mainly on the [MSNoise](https://github.com/ROBelgium/MSNoise) api, the [PyCWT](https://github.com/regeirk/pycwt), and the [disba](https://github.com/keurfonluu/disba) packages.
