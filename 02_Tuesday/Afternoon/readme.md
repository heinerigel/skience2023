## Introduction:
Three-component __seismic nodes__ are conquering the world these days as lightweight smart seismic sensors. SmartSolo 3D Nodes (https://smartsolo.com/cp.php?id=3) are easy to deploy, have long battery life (2-4 weeks), are modular to easily replace battery and are fastly charged. The picture below shows the modular design of the IGU-16HR 3C series where 3C sensors are installed on a standard battery pack (usually used with the 1C nodes). The tripod feet allow them to be used in urban settings. As they resemble to the Minions, we batised _data analysis with nodes_ as __Minionology__. We further refer to Zeckra et al. (submitted) to a technical introduction on the performance of the IGU-16HR 3C series.

The notebooks provided for this afternoon's class are simple introductions how to handle seismic nodes, how to perform H/V spectral ratio analysis of ambient noise (mHVSR) recorded with seismic nodes using the Geopsy software (Whathelet et al. 2021). We'll  show the Skience2013 crowd:
1. how to analyse seismic data using Geopsy manually and how to process the output data
2. how to do the same exercise automatically using the Geopsy command line and we'll open the discussion to more automatic solutions. 
3. Excercise the steps in 1. and 2. on new data gathered in the Bayrischzell valley
4. How to do a polarisation analysis of mHVSR data
