## Introduction:
Three-component __seismic nodes__ are conquering the world these days as lightweight smart seismic sensors. This notebook is a simple introduction how to handle seismic node data and perform H/V spectral ratio analysis of ambient noise (mHVSR) recorded with seismic nodes. We'll show you some methods:
* how to perform mHVSR using the Geopsy software manually
* how to do the same exercise automatically 
* and we'll open the discussion towards more automatic solutions given by the Skience2013 crowd. 

SmartSolo 3D Nodes (https://smartsolo.com/cp.php?id=3) are easy to deploy, have long battery life (2-4 weeks), are modular to easily replace battery and are fastly charged. The picture below shows the modular design of the IGU-16HR 3C series where 3C sensors are installed on a standard battery pack (usually used with the 1C nodes). The tripod feet allow them to be used in urban settings. As they resemble to the Minions, we batised _data analysis with nodes_ as __Minionology__. We further refer to Zeckra et al. (submitted) to a technical introduction on the performance of the IGU-16HR 3C series.
