    "Qopen can be used to estimate the scattering and intrinsic contributions to the attenuation for a local to regional dataset.  In addition, Qopen can be used to estimate relative site gains as a function of frequency and to estimate source spectra and source parameters, i.e., seismic moment, moment magnitude, corner frequency, and stress drop, for small to moderate earthquakes.\n",

    "### Site amplification and earthquake source properties\n",
    "\n",
    "While playing with the data we recognized, that noticed that both the site amplification (key `\"R\"`)and the source displacement spectra (key `\"sds\"`) are calculated by Qopen. Since b and g* are parameters of the medium, it makes sense to fix these two parameters if we want to put the focus on the simple gain factors (site and source). This can be done using Qopen's `fixed` command.\n",
    "Note, that the shape of the envelope is now fully constrained by the attenuation parameters. There is still an ambiguity between site and source. The perfect tradeoff between the site and source terms in equation (3) means that a site term scaled by some factor at all stations leads to an equivalent scaling of the spectral source energy by the inverse of that factor, and together they explain the observations just as well. To solve this problem, we define a reference site and set the site amplification at that site to 1. By default, the geometric mean of the site gain at all stations is set to 1, but it may be more appropriate to use a borehole station or a station with known low site gain as the reference site.\n",
    "\n",
    "After this step, we can take this approach even further -- site amplifications should also be fixed -- and we can recalculate the source spectra under these circumstances by fitting a single parameter $W(f)$ for each event and frequency band. In this way, source spectra of new earthquakes can also be estimated in a fast and robust manner. The flowchart below demonstrates the different steps and the corresponding invocation of Qopen commands.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Qopen flowchart](qopen_flow.svg)\n",
    "\n",
    "When using the `fixed` command, we need to specify the attenuation parameters. This is done with the `--input` option pointing to the results file of the previous run. Also, we do not want to plot attenuation results, and we select the station MPM as the reference site. This is an arbitrary choice. We could make a better and more informed choice, if we processed all 34 available stations. Please execute the following command in the `qopen` folder:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "qopen fixed --input \"01_go/results.json\" --prefix \"02_sites/\" --no-plot-results --align-sites --align-sites-station \"CI.MPM\" -vv\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Please compare the `sites.pdf` and `sds.pdf` and `mags.pdf` plots of the two different Qopen runs.  For the last step, we will run the `source` command once with the 8 earthquakes, and if we have enough time, we will run the same command for the 56 events in a retrospective monitoring mode. For this we use the `--events` parameter. In general, CLI parameters take precedence over configuration options. Please refer to the CLI help (e.g. `qopen source -h`) and the [API documentation](https://qopen.readthedocs.io), as all parameters are passed to the corresponding functions, for which you can find documentation there. We also specify the site amplification results from the previous run with the `--input-sites` parameter.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "qopen source --input \"01_go/results.json\" --input-sites \"02_sites/results.json\" --prefix \"03_source/\" --seismic-moment-options '{\"fc\": null, \"n\": 2.58, \"gamma\": 2}'  --no-plot-results -vv\n",
    "\n",
    "qopen source --events \"../data/events56.csz\" --input \"01_go/results.json\" --input-sites \"02_sites/results.json\" --prefix \"04_source_all/\" --seismic-moment-options '{\"fc\": null, \"n\": 2.58, \"gamma\": 2}'  --no-plot-results -vv\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "When fitting the source model to the source displacement spectrum, we also fixed the high-frequency fall-off $n$ here, as there is a large trade-off between $n$ and corner frequency.  In general, the processing can be improved in two ways: (1) using all stations of the dataset and, more importantly, (2) using more frequencies from 0.5 Hz up to the Nyquist frequency. When analyzing source parameters, the next step would be to check the statistics of source parameters (seismic moment, corner frequency, stress drop). But to do this, we would want to process the dataset with more stations and using more frequency bands.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, we load the events from the results file and plot a simple scaling between local magnitude and moment magnitude estimated by Qopen."
