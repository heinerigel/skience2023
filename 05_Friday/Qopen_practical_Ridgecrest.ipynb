    "# Qopen: Separation of intrinsic attenuation and scattering, site and source terms\n",

    "## Qopen practical using the 2019 Ridecrest Earthquake Sequence dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "*Author: Tom Eulenfeld*\n",
    "\n",
    "Qopen can be used to estimate the scattering and intrinsic contributions to the attenuation for a local to regional dataset.  In addition, Qopen can be used to estimate relative site gains as a function of frequency and to estimate source spectra and source parameters, i.e., seismic moment, moment magnitude, corner frequency, and stress drop, for small to moderate earthquakes.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook was created for the 13th Munich Earth Skience School (2023).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset used in this notebook and included in the repository is available at https://scedc.caltech.edu/data/stressdrop-ridgecrest.html\n",
    "and was used as a benchmark in the \"Community Stress Drop Validation Study using the 2019 Ridgecrest Earthquake Sequence\".\n",

    "The dataset consists of 56 earthquakes from the 2019 earthquake sequence. For most of this practical, we will use 8 selected events from these 56 events. Out of the 34 stations provided in the inventory, we will only use 6 stations to limit the runtime of Qopen\n",
    "\n",
    "### Setup\n",
    "\n",
    "To work through the practical, please download or clone this repository.\n",
    "You will need the following Python packages: `jupyter obspy qopen cartopy`.\n",
    "For ObsPy versions `<1.5` you will additionally need the package `obspycsv`.\n",
    "Finally, start the Jupyter notebook server with `jupyter notebook`.\n",
    "One of many possibilities for installation is via conda:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "conda create -c conda-forge -n practical jupyter obspy cartopy statsmodels\n",
    "conda activate practical\n",
    "pip install qopen\n",
    "#pip install obspycsv  # for ObsPy<1.5\n",
    "jupyter notebook\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Topics\n",
    "\n",
    "The notebook covers the following topics:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Plot event catalog with ObsPy and in a custom plot including depth sections\n",
    "2. Plot waveforms and calculate the seismic envelope and spectral energy density\n",
    "3. Understand impact of intrinsic attenuation and scattering on the seismic envelope\n",
    "4. Use Qopen to estimate intrinsic attenuation and scattering strength for a local dataset, load and plot results\n",
    "5. Calculate coda Q for one event-station pair and compare it with the Q estimates for scattering and intrinsic attenuation\n",
    "5. Estimate basic source parameters including the moment magnitude\n",
    "\n",
    "Answers and code updates can be directly inserted into this notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "The slides of an introductory talk presented at the 2023 Skience workshop are located in this repository.\n",
    "Additional resources are listed in the [Qopen repository](https://github.com/trichter/qopen).\n",
    "Get help in the [Qopen category of the ObsPy forum](https://discourse.obspy.org/c/obspy-related-projects/qopen/15).\n",
    "Bugs can be reported in the issue tracker of this repository.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1) Plot event catalog\n",
    "First, let us get an impression of the dataset with ObsPy's on-board tools. Light colored triangles show all stations of the provided inventory, solid colored triangles show the 6 selected stations. Circles represent earthquake hypocenters, color codes the depth, size the magnitude."

    "### Site amplification and earthquake source properties\n",
    "\n",
    "While playing with the Qopen results we noticed, that both the site amplification (key `\"R\"`) and the source displacement spectra (key `\"sds\"`) are calculated by Qopen. Since b and g* are parameters of the medium, it makes sense to fix these two parameters if we want to put the focus on the simple gain factors (site and source). This can be done using Qopen's `fixed` command.\n",
    "Note, that the shape of the envelope is now fully constrained by the attenuation parameters. There is still an ambiguity between site and source. The perfect tradeoff between the site and source terms in equation (3) means that a site term scaled by some factor at all stations leads to an equivalent scaling of the spectral source energy by the inverse of that factor, and together they explain the observations just as well. To solve this problem, we define a reference site and set the site amplification at that site to 1. By default, the geometric mean of the site gain at all stations is set to 1, but it may be more appropriate to use a borehole station or a station with known low site gain as the reference site.\n",
    "\n",
    "After this step, we can take this approach even further -- site amplifications should also be fixed -- and we can recalculate the source spectra under these circumstances by fitting a single parameter $W(f)$ for each event and frequency band. In this way, source spectra of new earthquakes can also be estimated in a fast and robust manner. The flowchart below demonstrates the different steps and the corresponding invocation of Qopen commands.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Qopen flowchart](qopen_flow.svg)\n",
    "\n",
    "When using the `fixed` command, we need to specify the attenuation parameters. This is done with the `--input` option pointing to the results file of the previous run. Also, we do not want to plot attenuation results, and we select the station MPM as the reference site. This is an arbitrary choice. We could make a better and more informed choice, if we processed all 34 available stations. *Please execute the following command in the `qopen` folder:*\n",

For the last step, we will run the `source` command once with the 8 earthquakes, and we will run the same command for the 56 events in a retrospective monitoring mode. For this we use the `--events` parameter. In general, CLI parameters take precedence over configuration options. Please refer to the CLI help (e.g. `qopen source -h`) and the [API documentation](https://qopen.readthedocs.io), as all parameters are passed to the corresponding functions, for which you can find documentation there.
